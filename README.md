Introduction

The number  of  thefts and identity fraud  have frequently  been reported  and has become significant issues. 
Almost every day one hears about damage or loss occurring due to security lapses or a lack of security on the news. 
Even the term security is not just limited to physical security nowadays. It includes things that are unseen but extremely valuable things. 
The home security system has become vital for every house. It’s important to know who’s on your property and who’s inside your buildings for 
both crime prevention and also as a safeguard in emergencies – emergency response personnel should know exactly how many people to account for and evacuate. 
It’s the duty of any society to provide their residents with a secure environment, keeping close track of what’s incoming and outgoing using appropriate security systems.


1.Problem Statement

Security has become a very critical and challenging task for a society to protect the society from burglars because of which the theft cases are rising. 
It is not always possible for the security guard to monitor the entire society round the clock. Due to this people get inside the society without any identity and there are sometimes no record of people entering and exiting the society .
There are incidents of robberies even in housing societies with security guards. Many times the guards of the society fall asleep at night which can compromise security. 
We  propose to make a system  that enforces security  checks  with the help of face recognition techniques. The system will have an android application which will keep  record of people entering the society and will make sure whoever is entering has valid permission to enter the society.



3.Scope of the Project
This project will be helpful to reduce the number of thefts.
The system detects the human face using a camera module interfaced with Raspberry Pi. The system is exposed to numerous facial images of people from different angles and background conditions. 
This forms the database to train the system which aids in facial recognition.  Subsequently, when the system detects a human face, it initiates an algorithm for recognition of face. 
According to images in the dataset, the system determines whether the human detected is a resident or a guest.
This system will be connected to the android application which will allows the owner to grant and deny access. The flat owner is given the authority to accept the entry and exit of a visitor by accepting or denying access through the mobile application which receives a notification when the visitor enters their details at the entrance of the building.
The owner is notified through the app on the arrival of a visitor before the visitor is allowed to enter the building.

4.Need for the Proposed System

Home security system is a crucial issue since it has to ensure properties and people living in the society are always safe and protected. It is necessary  to have a solid security system for a society in the most ideal and safe way. The most important part of any security system is the person's identification to enter and exit the society.
To attain the desired security they need to employ several specially trained personnel. These personnel, as human beings, make mistakes that might affect the level of security.
Our system will have an entry and exit camera which also recognises the face and log the entry and exit time of a person. 
The system maintains a history log of all the entry and exit activity. These details are accessible in case of mishaps. It helps identify the people entering and exiting the society.
Allows the owner to grant and deny access of the visitor if it is not legitimate.
The owner is notified through the app on the arrival of a visitor before the visitor is allowed to enter the building so that the owner has information about who’s on your property for crime prevention.

Face Recognition system
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. 
In our system it is used to detect and recognise a face to grant or deny access. 
It captures facial features of the face and compares it with the database to verify known or unknown faces.



Automated door lock and unlock system
Once the face is recognised a DC motor will lock and unlock the door using various sensors which will help to know if the door is open or closed. 
The door remains closed if the face is not recognised.

GUI based information collection system
This will be an interactive system such as a smartphone or a tablet which will run the android application. 
This application will ask visitors to enter details or OTP to get access.

Maintains an entry and exit database 
There is an exit camera which also recognises the face and logs the exit time of a person. 
The system maintains a history log of all the entry and exit activity. These details are accessible in case of mishaps. 
It helps identify the people entering and exiting the society.

Mobile application
Allows the owner to grant and deny access. 
The flat owner is given the authority to accept the entry and exit of a visitor by accepting or denying access 
through the mobile application which receives a notification when the visitor enters their details at the entrance of the building.

Notifies the owner on arrival of visitors 
The owner is notified through the app on the arrival of a visitor before the visitor is allowed to enter the building.

Displays history 
The app has an option where the owner can look at past activities by looking at the history or to grant temporary access to a guest or a local help to the building.

Provides information of local help
The app has a tab available where details of local help are available so an owner may get this information and use it when in need of local help.
 
Provides emergency numbers
The app has a tab where contact details of all the nearby emergency services are provided in case of an emergency. 

Provides notices board information
The app has a tab where the building notices are displayed. Which are easily accessible to the owner.
